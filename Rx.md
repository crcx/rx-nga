    a minimalist forth for nga

*Rx* (*retro experimental*) is a minimal Forth implementation for the Nga virtual machine. Like Nga this is intended to be used within a larger supporting framework adding I/O and other desired functionality. Various example interface layers are included.

## General Notes on the Source

Rx is developed using a literate tool called *unu*. This allows extraction of fenced code blocks into a separate file for later compilation. Developing in a literate approach is beneficial as it makes it easier for me to keep documentation current and lets me approach the code in a more structured manner.

The source is written in Naje, the standard assembler for Nga.

## In the Beginning..

All code built with the Nga toolchain starts with a jump to the main entry point. With cell packing, this takes two cells. We can take advantage of this knowledge to place a couple of variables at the start so they can be easily identified and interfaced with external tools. This is important as Nga allows for a variety of I/O models to be implemented and I don't want to tie Rx into any one specific model.

Here's the initial memory map:

| Offset | Contains                    | Notes              |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0      | lit call nop nop            | Compiled by *Naje* |
| 1      | Pointer to main entry point | Compiled by *Naje* |
| 2      | Dictionary                  |                    |
| 3      | Heap                        |                    |

Naje, the Nga assembler, compiles the initial instructions automatically. The two variables need to be declared next, so:

````
:Dictionary
  .ref 9999
:Heap
  .data 1536
:Version
  .data 201611
````

Both of these are pointers. **Dictionary** points to the most recent dictionary entry. (See the *Dictionary* section at the end of this file.) **Heap** points to the next free memory address. This is hard coded to an address beyond the end of the Rx kernel. It'll be fine tuned as development progresses. See the *Interpreter &amp; Compiler* section for more on this.

## Nga Instruction Set

The core Nga instruction set consists of 27 instructions. Rx begins by assigning each to a separate function. These are not intended for direct use; in Rx the compiler will fetch the opcode values to use from these functions when compiling. Some of them will also be wrapped in normal functions later.

````
:_nop
  .data 0
  ret
:_lit
  .data 1
  ret
:_dup
  .data 2
  ret
:_drop
  .data 3
  ret
:_swap
  .data 4
  ret
:_push
  .data 5

  .data 23
  ret
:_shift
  .data 24
  ret
:_zret
  .data 25
  ret
:_end
  .data 26
  ret
````

Nga also allows for multiple instructions to be packed into a single memory location (called a *cell*). Rx doesn't take advantage of this yet, with the exception of calls. Since calls take a value from the stack, a typical call (in Naje assembly) would look like:

    lit &bye
    call

Without packing this takes three cells: one for the lit, one for the address, and one for the call. Packing drops it to two since the lit/call combination can be fit into a single cell. We define the opcode for this here so that the compiler can take advantage of the space savings.

````
:_packedcall
  .data 2049
  ret
````

## Stack Shufflers

These add additional operations on the stack elements that'll keep later code much more readable.

````
:over
  push
    dup
  pop
  swap
  ret
:dup-pair
  lit &over
  call
  lit &over
  call
  ret
````

## Memory

The basic memory accesses are handled via **fetch** and **store**. These two functions provide slightly easier access to linear sequences of data.

**fetch-next** takes an address and fetches the stored value. It returns the next address and the stored value.

````
:fetch-next
  dup
  lit 1
  add
  swap
  fetch
  ret
````

**store-next** takes a value and an address. It stores the value to the address and returns the next address.

````
:store-next
  dup
  lit 1
  add
  push
    store
  pop
  ret
````

## Strings

The kernel needs two basic string operations for dictionary searches: obtaining the length and comparing for equality.

Strings in Rx are zero terminated. This is a bit less elegant than counted strings, but the implementation is quick and easy.

First up, string length. The process here is trivial:

* Make a copy of the starting point
* Fetch each character, comparing to zero

  * If zero, break the loop
  * Otherwise discard and repeat

* When done subtract the original address from the current one
* Then subtract one (to account for the zero terminator)

````
:count
  lit &fetch-next
  call
  zret
  drop
  lit &count
  jump
:str:length
  dup
  lit &count
  call
  lit 1
  sub
  swap
  sub
  ret
````

String comparisons are harder.

````
:get-set
  fetch
  swap
  fetch
  ret
:next-set
  lit 1
  add
  swap
  lit 1
  add
  ret
:compare
  push
    push
      lit &dup-pair
      call
      lit &get-set
      call
      eq?
    pop
    and
    push
      lit &next-set
      call
    pop
  pop
  lit 1
  sub
  zret
  lit &compare
  jump
:str:compare:mismatched
  drop
  drop
  lit 0
  dup
  ret
:str:eq
  lit &dup-pair
  call
  lit &str:length
  call
  swap
  lit &str:length
  call
  neq?
  lit &str:compare:mismatched
  ccall
  zret
  dup
  lit &str:length
  call
  lit -1
  swap
  lit &compare
  call
  push
    drop
    drop
  pop
  ret
````

## Conditionals

The Rx kernel provides three conditional forms:

    flag true-pointer false-pointer choose
    flag true-pointer if
    flag false-pointer -if

Implement **choose**, a conditional combinator which will execute one of two functions, depending on the state of a flag. We take advantage of a little hack here. Store the pointers into a jump table with two fields, and use the flag as the index. Default to the *false* entry, since a *true* flag is -1.

````
:choice:true
  .data 0
:choice:false
  .data 0
:choose
  lit &choice:false
  store
  lit &choice:true
  store
  lit &choice:false
  add
  fetch
  call
  ret
````

Next the two *if* forms:

````
:if
  ccall
  ret
:-if
  push
    lit 0
    eq?
  pop
  ccall
  ret
````

## Interpreter & Compiler

### Compiler Core

The heart of the compiler is **comma** which stores a value into memory and increments a variable (**Heap**) pointing to the next free address. **here** is a helper function that returns the address stored in **Heap**.

````
:comma
  lit &Heap
  fetch
  lit &store-next
  call
  lit &Heap
  store
  ret
````

With these we can add a couple of additional forms. **comma:opcode** is used to compile VM instructions into the current defintion. This is where those functions starting with an underscore come into play. Each wraps a single instruction. Using this we can avoid hard coding the opcodes.

````
:comma:opcode
  fetch
  lit &comma
  call
  ret
````

**comma:string** is used to compile a string into the current definition.

````
:($)
  lit &fetch-next
  call
  zret
  lit &comma
  call
  lit &($)
  jump
:comma:string
  lit &($)
  call
  drop
  lit 0
  lit &comma
  call
  ret
````

With the core functions above it's now possible to setup a few more things that make compilation at runtime more practical.

First, a variable indicating whether we should compile or run a function. This will be used by the *word classes*. I also define an accessor function named **compiling?** to aid in readability later on.

````
:Compiler
  .data 0
:compiling?
  lit &Compiler
  fetch
  ret
````

````
:t-;
  lit &_ret
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  lit 0
  lit &Compiler
  store
  ret
````

### Word Classes

Rx is built over the concept of *word classes*. Word classes are a way to group related words, based on their compilation and execution behaviors. A special word, called a *class handler*, is defined to handle an execution token passed to it on the stack. The compiler uses a variable named class to set the default class when compiling a word. We'll take a closer look at class later. Rx provides several classes with differing behaviors:

**class:data** provides for dealing with data structures.

| interpret            | compile                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| leave value on stack | compile value into definition |

````
:class:data
  lit &compiling?
  call
  zret
  drop
  lit &_lit
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  lit &comma
  call
  ret
````

**class:word** handles most functions.

| interpret            | compile                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| call a function      | compile a call to a function  |

````
:class:word:interpret
  call
  ret
:class:word:compile
  lit &_packedcall
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  lit &comma
  call
  ret
:class:word
  lit &compiling?
  call
  lit &class:word:compile
  lit &class:word:interpret
  lit &choose
  call
  ret
````

**class:primitive** is a special class handler for functions that correspond to Nga instructions.

| interpret            | compile                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| call the function    | compile the instruction into the definition |

````
:class:primitive
  lit &compiling?
  call
  lit &comma:opcode
  lit &class:word:interpret
  lit &choose
  call
  ret
````

**class:macro** is the class handler for *compiler macros*. These are functions that always get called. They can be used to extend the language in interesting ways.

| interpret            | compile                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| call the function    | call the function             |

````
:class:macro
  call
  ret
````

The class mechanism is not limited to these classes. You can write custom classes at any time. On entry the custom handler should take the XT passed on the stack and do something with it. Generally the handler should also check the **Compiler** state to determine what to do in either interpretation or compilation.

### Dictionary


Rx has a single dictionary consisting of a linked list of headers. The current form of a header is shown in the chart below. Pay special attention to the accessors. Each of these words corresponds to a field in the dictionary header. When dealing with dictionary headers, it is recommended that you use the accessors to access the fields since it is expected that the exact structure of the header will change over time.

| field | holds                                       | accessor |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| link  | link to the previous entry, 0 if last entry | d:link   |
| xt    | link to start of the function               | d:xt     |
| class | link to the class handler function          | d:class  |
| name  | zero terminated string                      | d:name   |

The initial dictionary is constructed at the end of this file. It'll take a form like this:

    :0000
      .ref 0
      .ref _add
      .ref class:word
      .string +
    :0001
      .ref 0000
      .ref _sub
      .ref class:word
      .string -

Each label will contain a reference to the prior one, the internal function name, its class, and a string indicating the name to expose to the Rx interpreter.

Rx will store the pointer to the most recent entry in a variable called **dictionary**. For simplicity, we just assign the last entry an arbitrary label of 9999. This is set at the start of the source. (See *In the Beginning...*)

Rx provides accessor functions for each field. Since the number of fields (or their ordering) may change over time, using these reduces the number of places where field offsets are hard coded.

````
:d:link
  lit 0
  add
  ret
:d:xt
  lit 1
  add
  ret
:d:class
  lit 2
  add
  ret
:d:name
  lit 3
  add
  ret
````

A traditional Forth has **create** to make a new dictionary entry pointing to **here**. Rx has **newentry** which serves as a slightly more flexible base. You provide a string for the name, a pointer to the class handler, and a pointer to the start of the function. Rx does the rest.

````
:newentry
  lit &Heap
  fetch
  push
    lit &Dictionary
    fetch
    lit &comma
    call
    lit &comma
    call
    lit &comma
    call
    lit &comma:string
    call
  pop
  lit &Dictionary
  store
  ret
````

Rx doesn't provide a traditional create as it's designed to avoid assuming a normal input stream and prefers to take its data from the stack.

### Dictionary Search

````
:Which
  .data 0
:Needle
  .data 0

:found
  lit &Which
  store
  lit &_nop
  ret

:find
  lit 0
  lit &Which
  store
  lit &Dictionary
  fetch
:find_next
  zret
  dup
  lit &d:name
  call
  lit &Needle
  fetch
  lit &str:eq
  call
  lit &found
  ccall
  fetch
  lit &find_next
  jump
:d:lookup
  lit &Needle
  store
  lit &find
  call
  lit &Which
  fetch
  ret
````

### Number Conversion

This code converts a zero terminated string into a number. The approach is very simple:

* Store an internal multiplier value (-1 for negative, 1 for positive)
* Clear an internal accumulator value
* Loop:

  * Fetch the accumulator value
  * Multiply by 10
  * For each character, convert to a numeric value and add to the accumulator
  * Store the updated accumulator

* When done, take the accumulator value and the modifier and multiply them to get the final result

At this time Rx only supports decimal numbers.

````
:to-number:Mod
  .data 0
:to-number:Acc
  .data 0
:to-number:char>digit
  lit 48
  sub
  ret
:to-number:scale
  lit &to-number:Acc
  fetch
  lit 10
  mul
  ret
:to-number:convert
  lit &fetch-next
  call
  zret
  lit &to-number:char>digit
  call
  lit &to-number:scale
  call
  add
  lit &to-number:Acc
  store
  lit &to-number:convert
  jump
:to-number:prepare
  lit 1
  lit &to-number:Mod
  store
  lit 0
  lit &to-number:Acc
  store
  dup
  fetch
  lit 45
  eq?
  zret
  drop
  lit -1
  lit &to-number:Mod
  store
  lit 1
  add
  ret
:str:to-number
  lit &to-number:prepare
  call
  lit &to-number:convert
  call
  drop
  lit &to-number:Acc
  fetch
  lit &to-number:Mod
  fetch
  mul
  ret
````

### Token Processing

An input token has a form like:

    <prefix-char>string

Rx will check the first character to see if it matches a known prefix. If it does, it will pass the string (without the token) to the prefix handler. If not, it will attempt to find the token in the dictionary.

Prefixes are handled by functions with specific naming conventions. A prefix name should be:

    prefix:<prefix-char>

Where *&lt;prefix-char&gt;* is the character for the prefix. These should be compiler macros (using the **class:macro** class) and watch the **compiler** state to decide how to deal with the token. To find a prefix, Rx stores the prefix character into a string named **prefixed**. It then searches for this string in the dictionary. If found, it sets an internal variable (**prefix:handler**) to the dictionary entry for the handler function. If not found, **prefix:handler** is set to zero. The check, done by **prefix?**, also returns a flag.

````
:prefix:handler
  .data 0
:prefixed
  .string prefix:_
:prefix:prepare
  fetch
  lit &prefixed
  lit 7
  add
  store
  ret
:prefix?
  lit &prefix:prepare
  call
  lit &prefixed
  lit &d:lookup
  call
  dup
  lit &prefix:handler
  store
  lit 0
  neq?
  ret
````

Rx uses prefixes for important bits of functionality including parsing numbers (prefix with **#**), obtaining pointers (prefix with **&amp;**), and starting new functions (using the **:** prefix).

| prefix | used for          | example |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------- |
| #      | numbers           | #100    |
| $      | ASCII characters  | $e      |
| &amp;  | pointers          | &swap   |
| :      | definitions       | :foo    |

````
:prefix:#
  lit &str:to-number
  call
  lit &class:data
  call
  ret
:prefix:$
  fetch
  lit &class:data
  call
  ret
:prefix::

  store
  ret
:prefix:&
  lit &d:lookup
  call
  lit &d:xt
  call
  fetch
  lit &class:data
  call
  ret
````

### Quotations

Quotations are anonymous, nestable blocks of code. Rx uses them for control structures and some aspects of data flow. A quotation takes a form like:

    [ #1 #2 ]
    #12 [ square #144 eq? [ #123 ] [ #456 ] choose ] call

Begin a quotation with **[** and end it with **]**.

````
:t-[
  lit &Heap
  fetch
  lit 3
  add
  lit &Compiler
  fetch
  lit -1
  lit &Compiler
  store
  lit &_lit
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  lit &Heap
  fetch
  lit 0
  lit &comma
  call
  lit &_jump
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  lit &Heap
  fetch
  ret
:t-]
  lit &_ret
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  lit &Heap
  fetch
  swap
  lit &_lit
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  lit &comma
  call
  swap
  store
  lit &Compiler
  store
  lit &compiling?
  call
  zret
  drop
  drop
  ret
````

## Lightweight Control Structures

Rx provides a couple of functions for simple flow control apart from using quotations. These are **repeat**, **again**, and **0;**. An example of using them:

    : str:length dup repeat @+ 0; drop again swap - #1 - ;

These can only be used within a definition or quotation. If you need to use them interactively, wrap them in a quote and **call** it.

````
:repeat
  lit &Heap
  fetch
  ret
:again
  lit &_lit
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  lit &comma
  call
  lit &_jump
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  ret
:t-0;
  lit &compiling?
  call
  zret
  drop
  lit &_zret
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  ret
````

````
:t-push
  lit &compiling?
  call
  zret
  drop
  lit &_push
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  ret
:t-pop
  lit &compiling?
  call
  zret
  drop
  lit &_pop
  lit &comma:opcode
  call
  ret
````

## Interpreter

The *interpreter* is what processes input. What it does is:

* Take a string
* See if the first character has a prefix handler

  * Yes: pass the rest of the string to the prefix handler for processing
  * No: lookup in the dictionary

    * Found: pass xt of word to the class handler for processing
    * Not found: report error via **err:notfound**

First up, the handler for dealing with words that are not found. This is defined here as a jump to the handler for the Nga *NOP* instruction. It is intended that this be hooked into and changed.

As an example, in Rx code, assuming an I/O interface with some support for strings and output:

    [ $? putc space 'word not found' puts ]
    &err:notfound #1 + store

````
:err:notfound
  lit &_nop
  jump
  ret
````

**call:dt** takes a dictionary token and pushes the contents of the **d:xt** field to the stack. It then calls the class handler stored in **d:class**.

````
:call:dt
  dup
  lit &d:xt
  call
  fetch
  swap
  lit &d:class
  call
  fetch
  call
  ret
````

````

## The Initial Dictionary

The dictionary is a linked list. This sets up the initial dictionary. Maintenance of this bit is annoying, but it generally shouldn't be necessary to change this unless you are adding new functions to the Rx kernel.
